## Will the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies Collide?

For a long time, scientists believed that our galaxy (the Milky Way) would crash into the nearby Andromeda galaxy in the future. This collision was thought to be unavoidable.

But new research using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gaia mission shows that things might not be so certain. Astronomers now think there is only about a 50% chance that the Milky Way and Andromeda will actually collide. That means it is just as likely that they might pass by each other without crashing!

## Why Was a Collision Expected?

Earlier, computer models showed that gravity would pull the two galaxies together, causing them to merge into one. This would trigger many new stars and could even change where our Sun is in the galaxy.

Now, with better and more detailed data, scientists have found there are many factors—like the speed and direction of the galaxies and the pull from smaller nearby galaxies—that make it hard to predict what will happen.

## What Did the New Study Do?

Scientists ran 100,000 computer simulations (like virtual experiments) to see what could happen. About half the time, the Milky Way and Andromeda passed close to each other but did not collide. The other half of the time, they did crash together. Sometimes, they just kept orbiting each other for a very long time.

There is still a tiny chance (about 2%) that a head-on collision could happen in about 4 or 5 billion years. But this is not very likely.

## What Does This Mean for Us?

We can’t be sure what will happen to our galaxy in the far future, even with the best data. The Milky Way and Andromeda could collide, or they could just keep moving around each other. Either way, this won’t happen for billions of years, so it’s nothing to worry about!
