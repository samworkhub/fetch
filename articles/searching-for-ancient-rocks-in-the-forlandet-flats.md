[![A color image from the Martian surface shows uneven yellow-tan ground that rises from the foreground upward toward the upper right corner of the image and off the frame. The ground appears dry, with narrow cracks dividing the ground into squares and other angular shapes. A narrow strip of smoother ground, like a low berm of mounded sand, curves from the left side toward the middle of the image. Beyond that, toward the upper left, the dry ground is more gravel-covered.](https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/mars2020/2025/perseverance-rover-updates/Mars_Perseverance_NLF_1512_0801175461_522ECM_N0740000NCAM02512_04_195J.png?w=1288&h=968&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint)](https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/mars2020/2025/perseverance-rover-updates/Mars_Perseverance_NLF_1512_0801175461_522ECM_N0740000NCAM02512_04_195J.png?w=1288&h=968&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint)

NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover acquired this image of the “Fallbreen” workspace using its onboard Left Navigation Camera (Navcam). The camera is located high on the rover's mast and aids in driving. This image was acquired on May 22, 2025 (Sol 1512, or Martian day 1,512 of the Mars 2020 mission) at the local mean solar time of 14:39:01.

This week Perseverance continued its gradual descent into the relatively flat terrain outside of Jezero Crater. In this area, the science team expects to find rocks that could be among the oldest ever observed by the Perseverance rover — and perhaps any rover to have explored the surface of Mars — presenting a unique opportunity to understand Mars’ ancient past. Perseverance is now parked at “[Fallbreen](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/NLF_1512_0801175461_522ECM_N0740000NCAM02512_04_195J),” a light-toned bedrock exposure that the science team hopes to compare to the nearby olivine-bearing outcrop at “[Copper Cove](https://science.nasa.gov/blog/a-dust-devil-photobombs-perseverance/).” This could be a glimpse of the geologic unit rich in olivine and carbonate that stretches hundreds of kilometers to the west of Jezero Crater. Gaining insight into how these rocks formed could have profound implications for our constantly evolving knowledge of this region’s history. Perseverance’s recent traverses marked another notable transition. After rolling past Copper Cove, Perseverance entered the “Forlandet” quadrangle, a 1.2-square-kilometer (about 0.46 square mile, or 297-acre) area along the edge of the crater that the science team named after Forlandet National Park on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Discovered in the late 16th century by Dutch explorers, this icy set of islands captured the imagination of a generation of sailors searching for the Northwest Passage. While Perseverance is in the Forlandet quad, landforms and rock targets will be named informally after sites in and around this national park on Earth. As the rover navigates through its own narrow passes in the spirit of discovery, driving around sand dunes and breezing past buttes, we hope it channels the perseverance of the explorers who once gave these rocks their names.
