### ROA-2025 NRA Amendment 1 – OPEN

**Advanced Air Vehicles Program Fellowship Opportunities**

[(View the full ROA-2025 NRA Amendment 1 text here.)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1077640/solicitationId=%7BD77CD13F-7F09-6443-54D7-C366E0C03DD4%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/AAVP%20Fellowship%20Amendment.pdf)

This announcement solicits proposals from accredited U.S. institutions for research training grants to begin the academic year. This Notice of Funding Opportunity is designed to support independently conceived research projects by highly qualified graduate students in disciplines needed to help advance NASA’s mission, thus affording these students the opportunity to directly contribute to advancements in STEM-related areas of study. These opportunities are focused on innovation and the generation of measurable research results that contribute to NASA’s current and future science and technology goals.

Research proposals are sought to address the key challenges summarized in the Elements section at the end of the [Amendment 1 document](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1077640/solicitationId=%7BD77CD13F-7F09-6443-54D7-C366E0C03DD4%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/AAVP%20Fellowship%20Amendment.pdf), and which reference NASA’s [Hypersonic Technology](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/aavp/hypersonic-technology-project/) project.

**UPDATE for June 6: Reflecting the Fiscal Year 2026 budget changes, the [Transformational Tools & Technologies](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/tacp/ttt/) project opportunities originally described in this announcement were cancelled. Proposals citing this project will not be evaluated.**

Notices of Intent are not required.

A budget breakdown for each proposal is required, detailing the allocation of the award funds by year. The budget document may adhere to any format or template provided by the applicant’s institution. Two pre-proposal teleconferences for potential proposers will be held and meeting links will be posted on NSPIRES.

**Proposals are due by 5 p.m. EDT on June 11, 2025.**

NASA’s [University Leadership Initiative](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/tacp/ui/uli/) (ULI) provides the opportunity for university teams to exercise technical and organizational leadership in proposing unique technical challenges in aeronautics, defining multi-disciplinary solutions, establishing peer review mechanisms, and applying innovative teaming strategies to strengthen the research impact.

Research proposals are sought in six ULI topic areas in Appendix D.4.

Topic 1: Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations

Topic 2: Innovation in Commercial High-Speed Aircraft

Topic 3: Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports

Topic 4: Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles

Topic 5: In-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance

Topic 6: Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation

This NASA Research Announcement will utilize a two-step proposal submission and evaluation process. The initial step is a short **mandatory Step-A proposal, which is due June 26, 2025**. Those offerors submitting the most highly rated Step-A proposals will be invited to submit a Step-B proposal. All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES at [https://nspires.nasaprs.com](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/). An Applicant’s Workshop will be held on Thursday April 30, 2025; 1:00-3:00 p.m. ET (<https://uli.arc.nasa.gov/applicants-workshops/workshop9>) (Page will be live closer to the event.)

An interested partners list for this ULI is at <https://uli.arc.nasa.gov/partners>. To be listed as an interested lead or partner, please send an email to [hq-univpartnerships@mail.nasa.gov](mailto:hq-univpartnerships@mail.nasa.gov) with “ULI Partnerships” in the subject line and include the information required for the table on that web page.

### ROA-2024 NRA Amendment 4 – OPEN

**University Student Research Challenge**

[(View the full ROA-2024 NRA Amendment 4 text here)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1024937/solicitationId=%7BCD0E90F9-A540-10C4-8E5E-B0EC0FA18298%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/2.%20Front%20End%20ROA-%202024%20Amendment%204_44pp.pdf)

NASA’s [University Student Research Challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/tacp/ui/usrc/) (USRC) seeks to challenge students to propose new ideas/concepts that are relevant to NASA Aeronautics.  The challenge will provide students from accredited U.S. colleges or universities with grants for their projects, as well as the challenge of raising cost share funds through a crowdfunding campaign. The process of creating and implementing a crowdfunding campaign acts as a teaching accelerator — requiring students to act like entrepreneurs and raise awareness about their research among the public.

The solicitation goal can be accomplished through project ideas such as advancing the design, developing technology or capabilities in support of aviation, by demonstrating a novel concept, or enabling advancement of aeronautics-related technologies.

Notices of Intent are not required for this solicitation.

**Proposals for Cycle 3 are due June 26, 2025**.

Proposals can also be submitted later and evaluated in the second and third cycles.

The USRC Q&A/Info Session and Proposal Workshop will be held on the days/times below. Please join us on TEAMS using the [Meeting Link](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/t-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%253ameeting_N2NlY2ZkNTgtMzkyYi00NWI5LWI3MjItNGJmNjQ2Y2UwNDQz%2540thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%25227005d458-45be-48ae-8140-d43da96dd17b%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%2522831a92f6-eb15-4049-a85e-5a2b0f7a90c7%2522%257d&data=05%7C02%7Cjim.banke%40nasa.gov%7C8843efe01beb48e936e908dcd9b15d51%7C7005d45845be48ae8140d43da96dd17b%7C0%7C0%7C638624603127369317%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2BOyPSxgdp3q%2FbqT7UGn%2F08PB%2Fb6ribPts8hdhumxIBE%3D&reserved=0), or call in via [+1 256-715-9946,,317928116#](tel:+12567159946,,317928116).

## NASA Research Opportunities in Aeronautics

Competition for NRA awards is open to both academia and industry.

The current open solicitations for ARMD Research Opportunities are [ROA-2024](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7bCD0E90F9-A540-10C4-8E5E-B0EC0FA18298%7d&path=open) and [ROA-2025](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={CA4C933E-A3EB-3458-01DA-68A0F0F04F30}&path=open).

Here is some general information to know about the NRA process.

- NRA solicitations are released by NASA Headquarters through the Web-based NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System ([NSPIRES](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/index.do)).
- All NRA technical work is defined and managed by project teams within these four programs: [Advanced Air Vehicles Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/aavp/), [Airspace Operations and Safety Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/aosp/),[Integrated Aviation Systems Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/iasp/), and [Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/tacp/).
- NRA awards originate from NASA’s [Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley/) in Virginia, [Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) in California, [Glenn Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/glenn/) in Cleveland, and [Armstrong Flight Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/armstrong/) in California.
- Competition for NRA awards is full and open.
- Participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry, and nonprofits.
- Any updates or amendments to an NRA is posted on the appropriate NSPIRES web pages as noted in the Amendments detailed below.
- ARMD sends notifications of NRA updates through the NSPIRES email system. In order to receive these email notifications, you must be a Registered User of NSPIRES. However, note that NASA is not responsible for inadvertently failing to provide notification of a future NRA. Parties are responsible for regularly checking the NSPIRES website for updated NRAs.
