NASA astronaut [Ed White](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-edward-h-white-ii/), pilot of the [Gemini IV](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/gemini-iv/) mission, floats in space on June 3, 1965, while performing the [first spacewalk by an American](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/gemini/gemini-iv-learning-to-walk-in-space/). As White floated outside the spacecraft, he used a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, informally called a “zip gun.” The device, seen in White’s right hand in this image, expelled pressurized oxygen to provide thrust for controlling his movements outside the capsule.

“You look beautiful, Ed,” remarked fellow crew member astronaut [James A. McDivitt](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/former-astronauts/former-astronaut-james-a-mcdivitt-jr/), who remained inside the spacecraft, as he began taking pictures of White tumbling around outside his window. [“I feel like a million dollars,”](https://appel.nasa.gov/2022/06/09/this-month-in-nasa-history-engineering-the-first-american-spacewalk/) White said. “This is the greatest experience. It’s just tremendous.”
