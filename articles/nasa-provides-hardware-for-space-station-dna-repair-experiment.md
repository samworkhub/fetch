When it comes to helping NASA scientists better understand the effects of space travel on the human body, fruit flies are the heavyweights of experiments in weightlessness. Because humans and fruit flies share a lot of similar genetic code, they squeeze a lot of scientific value into a conveniently small, light package. 

Through a new Space Act Agreement between NASA and Axiom Space, the [Vented Fly Box](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/space-biosciences/fruit-fly-lab/) will enable fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to launch aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. These tiny crew members will join the Axiom Mission 4 crew for scientific investigations on the International Space Station. The goal is to advance research into how spaceflight impacts DNA repair, a key factor in astronaut health on long-term space missions.

For decades, NASA has iterated and improved these [specialized habitats](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fruitflyfs_20oct17-as_posted.pdf?emrc=ea7030) to safely house generations of fruit flies for their trips to and from space. As the go-to organism for many of its studies, NASA gained unique knowledge and carefully finessed the steps astronauts take to perform the most efficient and rewarding life science experiments in space.

The study is supported by NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and Axiom Space.
